# harisapp-numberguessing-py
"Guess the Number" is an interactive game built with Python and Streamlit. The application generates a random secret number between 1 and 100, and challenges the user to guess it. Users can input their guesses through a simple numerical input field and receive immediate feedback indicating whether their guess is too high or too low
